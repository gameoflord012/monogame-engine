1. Transform component
	Some component may need properties from other component. For example:
		-Sprite renderer may need transform component
		-Godot body need box collider from child component

	General rules or should be no rule at all :)
		-The child behaviour depend on the property of parent
		-There're can be exception ...
		-There may be component constraints
